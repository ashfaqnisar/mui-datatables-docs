# Configuration

Documents are **groups of pages** connected through:

- a **sidebar**
- **previous/next navigation**
- **versioning**

## Create your first Doc

Create a markdown file at `docs/hello.md`:

```md title="docs/hello.md"
# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

A new document is now available at `http://localhost:3000/docs/hello`.

## Configure the Sidebar

Docusaurus automatically **creates a sidebar** from the `docs` folder.

Add metadata to customize the sidebar label and position:

```md title="docs/hello.md" {1-4}
---
sidebar_label: 'Hi!'
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

It is also possible to create your sidebar explicitly in `sidebars.js`:

```diff title="sidebars.js"
module.exports = {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorial',
-     items: [...],
+     items: ['hello'],
    },
  ],
};
```

# Examples

Docusaurus creates a **page for each blog post**, but also a **blog index page**, a **tag system**, an **RSS** feed...

## Create your first Post

Create a file at `blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md`:

```md title="blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md"
---
slug: greetings

# Deploy your site

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at `http://localhost:3000/`.

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
